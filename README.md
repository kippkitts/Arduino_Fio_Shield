Arduino_Fio_Shield
==================

For projects that require wireless control of high power devices, the Fio Shield provides a solution.  It features six IRF540 high power MOSFETS that can support 28 Amp loads, each of which is tied to a PWM enabled pin on the Arduino Fio.  This allows your Fio to interface with all sorts of high load devices (solenoids, lamps, pumps, motors, fans, etc.), and with an Xbee attached, you can control these devices remotely.  The analog pins, the rest of the digital IO pins, and the 3V3 pin of the Fio are also broken out on the shield for greater flexibility.  The Eagle CAD files for the Fio Shield are provided here.
